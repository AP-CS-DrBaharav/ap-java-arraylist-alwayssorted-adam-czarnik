/**
 *
 * 
 * Write a class KList
 * 
 * The class should have a:
 * 1. private variable which is an ArrayList of Integers. Call this variable A.
 * 2. Constructor that accepts an array of already sorted integers, and assign these to A.
 *  The first element in the array is the smallest, and the last one is the largest.
 * 3. Constructor that takes NO arguments, and sets A to an empty list.
 * 4. Method add() that returns void, and accepts an integer value. The value is added to A
 * such that A is still sorted.
 * 5. Method remove that accepts an integer, and removes the value in A at this location. It
 * returns the value as an integer. If the index is out of bounds, nothing is removed and the
 * returned value is zero.
 * 6. A function toString, that returns a String that will include all the elements of A
 * and will produce the output as below:
 * 
 * 
 * Expected output:

Original    :  {4 , 7 , 8 };
Adding 2,5,9:  {2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 };
Empty  k1   :  { };
Empty  k2   :  { };
Adding 2,5,9:  {2 , 5 , 9 };
Removing    :  { };
